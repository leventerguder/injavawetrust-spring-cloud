# Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that to which you want to tightly control access,
# such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive information.
# Vault provides a unified interface to any secret while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

# To enable the config server to use a Vault backend, you can run your config server with the vault profile.
# For example, in your config serverâ€™s application.properties, you can add spring.profiles.active=vault.

# All configurable properties can be found in org.springframework.cloud.config.server.environment.VaultEnvironmentProperties.
